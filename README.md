# Laput_Dixie_Earbuds
This repository is for the Earbuds Promotional Page project. In this project, we are to explore and design innovative concepts for a new pair of earbuds and the charging case. The goal is to model, texture, light, and animate these designs using Cinema 4D and integrate them into an interactive promotional website. The project includes creating assets such as multiple color variations of the earbuds, an X-ray view of the internal components, and promotional images or animations.
